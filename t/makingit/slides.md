# Making It
## Building a Career in Silicon Valley

???

Our careers are what we make of them, and in the end, understanding what you truly want, connecting with the people with whom you share a passion, and finding the company that's aligned with your personal mission will take you far.

If you're coming across these slides from the presentation's link or happened across them on the Internet, welcome. This was a talk given to students at California State University, Monterey Bay April 3, 2015. The talk was a reflection on over a decade of career building in Silicon Valley, and some of the learnings worth sharing along the way.

Like you, I started here. Well, not in this room, but here at CSUMB. The program was called "Telecommunications, Multimedia, and Applied Computing" then, but the fundamentals of the program remain unchanged. Today isn't a formula for success; success is going to mean different things to different people. This is a foundation for building success, based on my personal experiences and those of my colleagues and mentors.

???

First, an abbreviated version of my own story. After graduating CSUMB, I took a job at the Naval Postgraduate School as a PHP programmer. It was an entry level technical job, but it allowed me to continue to learn new things. While this was technically my first job, it wasn't until my next employer that I really got started.

???

Gaia Online had a mission of being a social destination for teenagers. With a company size of 10, this was the stereotypical Silicon Valley startup. I was still living in Monterey with a commute to Milpitas; that lasted all of 6 months. I moved up to Silicon Valley and spent about 4 years there. Over my tenure there, I became less enfranchised with PHP and more enamored with technology for the browser.

???

In 2008, I committed fully to the browser, changing my title to "Web Developer" and switching roles to a professional networking site that was about the same age Gaia was. I remained at LinkedIn for 6 1/2 years, became a Senior Manager, and helped build out our technical programming tracks at the company.

---

???

Next for me is still an open question. The time I had at LinkedIn has afforded me the ability to step back from the pace of startups, reflect on my values, and better understand what I want to do with my career.

Eric asked that I talk with you all about a career in Silicon Valley. What it takes, how you build one, and where it takes you. Since that's a lot of content for an hour when we add questions in, I'm going to leave this talk focused on now, your first job, and transitioning to your next.

# Right Now
## Here at CSUMB

???

It all begins with education. Specifically, your education here at CSUMB.

---

background-image: url(https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/493580/Presentations/makingit/csumb_fog.jpg)

???

Here, in this room, you're going to be at various stages of CSUMB's capstone process. This is the most important project you are undertaking through the school, and is a launchpad to your first opportunities. Silicon Valley loves seeing tangible work, and having something in hand will allow you to showcase the technical and soft skills you've learned here.

---

???

For the designers, a site like [Dribbble](https://dribbble.com) (three B's) or [Behance](https://www.behance.net) gives you an online portfolio for your work and ideas. You don't need to create the technology infrastructure behind your portfolio, but you do need to showcase your work.

---

background-image: url(https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/493580/Presentations/makingit/github_screenshot.jpg)

???

For the developers, sites like [GitHub](https://github.com) or [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org) are places where your code can live and be viewable by everyone. Work to have a collection of projects you understand, contribute to, or created.

In either case, your capstone is probably the first thing you'll put into these sites. However, you should continue to add to these things while you are employed, and work to keep them rich with content and current.

???

One of the big reasons for building a public representation of yourself is Google. To be honest, many recruiters begin their research of a candidate by typing their name into google.com (and sometimes with their current employer or school added for common names) and seeing what comes back.

You definitely want your professional stuff coming back on the first few results. You want these links to paint a complete picture of your professional experience.

# First Job
## You're in Silicon Valley, Now What?

???

And eventually, this work cumulates in your first job in the valley. It's the begining of an exciting journey. It's important (and humbling) to realize this will be the first of many great opportunities, companies, and people you will get to work with.

---

background-image: url(https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/493580/Presentations/makingit/sxsw_panel.jpg)

???

Starting with here, in this room, you are beginning to build your professional network. These are similar minded individuals with whom you share an industry and a passion. Throughout your career, you are going to build relationships with these colleagues. Keep in touch and keep up with their careers. As you develop your career, the people you know will inevitably end up in places of interest to you and vice versa.

???

Being in a job will afford you two kinds of growth. We'll call them "personal" and "professional" growth. Personal growth is the inwardly focused items. The things you personally want to learn, possibly (but not always) related to your career. Making gains towards who you want to be, and being at an employer that supports who you want to become is one of the most important traits to look for in a company. Professional growth is the career growth you experience directly related to your work. You will learn new languages, new techniques, and many skills for which experience is the only teacher. Seize new opportunities and be willing to take risks early in your career. The learning you have now is invaluable later.

![A picture of The Startup of YOU](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/493580/Presentations/makingit/startup_of_you.jpg)

???

In fact, I'm a fan of the concept of a "Tour of Duty" as pioneered by Reid Hoffman and Ben Casnocha in [The Startup of YOU](http://www.thestartupofyou.com/). Reid suggests that as part of your job, you should establish upfront how long you want to invest in the company before you take stock again. By giving yourself a timebox (he recommends 2-4 years), you can remain very focused through a generation of a product and then reevaluate what your next step will be. This could be at your current company or it could also be with another opportunity.

> A tour of duty has a .emphasis[specific mission] with a .emphasis[realistic time horizon] .cite[Reid Hoffman]

???

A tour of duty has two distinct parts. A specific mission- what you intend to achieve during your time with the company, and a realistic time in which you want to accomplish this. Without the former, there is no direction and without the later there is no focusing function for your objective. Combined, however, they form a powerful tool. So in your first job, give yourself goals from this job, and a number of years you want to achieve them in. And then, when that time comes, take stock and have honest conversations.

# Staying / Leaving
## Evaluating Your Options

???

Eventually, you and your company are going to part ways. It should be amicable, and if you're being upfront about your goals, it will be clear to both you and your manager when the time is right to leave. What matters the most to you will heavily influence wether you stay or go.

---

background-image: url(https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/493580/Presentations/makingit/stack_of_money.jpg)

???

Let's just address the elephant in the room: money. If increasing your cash flow (the amount per-paycheck) is a direct goal of interest to you, then be willing to ask for and justify an increase in your salary. Many times, changing roles is the easiest way to increase your pay, but not always the best.

---

background-image: url(https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/493580/Presentations/makingit/stock_checking.jpg)

???

So let's keep talking about money. Money comes in several forms. Just straight "dolla dolla bills" are not the end all be all of compensation. In fact, you need to be looking at something called your Total Compensation Package, or TCP. Beyond just your base pay, there are many other factors that are part of your compensation. Bonuses, stock options, a 401k, and company perks should all be part of how you evaluate your financial options. Don't just look at the bottom line in your offer letter, because it's much deeper than that.

---

background-image: url(https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/493580/Presentations/makingit/linkedin_2m.jpg)

???

And let's move beyond just the monetary side of things. While your finances do play a big role in evaluating your options, there is a lot more to a career than just salary or even TCP. Being open, honest, and transparent with your boss about your career goals (remember: Tours of Duty) will help you make a decision that goes beyond just the dollars and cents. Companies grow.

---

background-image: url(https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/493580/Presentations/makingit/linkedin_300m.jpg)

???

And as a company grows, so too does your opportunities to take on new challenges. A company that can help you meet your career goals will always be stronger long term than someone who can simply pay. Nowadays, everyone has a cool idea with free lunch. You need to be satisfied with the work you are doing.

---

background-image: url(https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/493580/Presentations/makingit/orlovsky_and_oculus_rift.jpg)

???

So if you're staying, be sure you are staying for the right reasons. Be honest with yourself about your motivations and what's important for you.

---

background-image: url(https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/493580/Presentations/makingit/serene_landscape.jpg)

???

If you're leaving, be sure it too is for the right reasons. The more honest you are with yourself, the easier it is to make the right decision.

# Conducting a Job Search
## Looking for the Next Thing

???

Leaving is on the table, and it's time to look. There are two main flows in looking for a job: either you have a lot of time for this, or you don't. Sometimes, things are just not working out for you at a company sooner rather than later. The amount of time you have is directly porportional to the number of companies you'll be able to have a conversation with. You'll be relying in both cases on that professional network you have built up, along with your strong research skills.

---

background-image: url(https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/493580/Presentations/makingit/linkedin_chocolate.jpg)

???

Let's just get this out of the way. When you need to look up people, [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com) is a go-to tool. This is especially true for our industry. You don't need to be crazy-obsessive about updating your profile, but you should at the least ensure there are links to your work and a brief resume-style outline of your experience.

---

![Crunchbase Logo](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/493580/Presentations/makingit/crunchbase_logo.png)

???

And whatever you can't find on LinkedIn, probably exists on [CrunchBase](https://crunchbase.com). CrunchBase is a useful tool for researching the funding and capital side of a company. You can learn where in a company's growth they are, some of their notable hires, and look for any additional press they may have generated.

---

background-image: url(https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/493580/Presentations/makingit/paper_stack.jpg)

???

Don't start by sending out resumes everywhere. Getting a resume past a recruiter can be a challenging task. Instead, start with the people you know. Use LinkedIn, see who you know at the company, and ask for an introduction. And if you don't know anyone, then you can go the traditional route. However, an introduction will always go farther.

---

background-image: url(https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/493580/Presentations/makingit/i_quit_whiteboard.jpg)

???

And when you do leave, leave on good terms. Don't burn your bridges, even if the situation isn't working out well. If there's any cautionary tales to be had today, it's about the interconnected nature of Silicon Valley. As you build your career, you will learn how we are all related through the companies we work for. Alumni from your current company will spread out, as will happen with your next company, and the one after that. Leave on good terms.

---

background-image: url(https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/493580/Presentations/makingit/playground_gym.jpg)

???

And repeat. You will identify what you want to achieve, your long term goals, and how your current company helps you meet those goals. You'll commit to a length of time, reevaluate at the end, and determine your next step. Careers are rarely like ladders; a jungle gym is a better analogy. There's no right way to move through the career, and it will be different for everyone. As long as you stay honest with yourself, you'll do just fine.
