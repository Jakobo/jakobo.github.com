title: The Fitness Wristband Shootout
---

Ever since I invoked the 4 hour body and shed 50 pounds, I've been looking for simple ways to continue to measure my day to day progress. As my weight has shifted up or down, I've been trying to identify outliers in behavior that caused the change. Lucky for me, 2013 is the year of the "wearable fitness". Nike, Fitbit, Jawbone, and Motorola are all in the game. At an uncomfortable sum of money per wristband though, it's an expensive experiment to try them all and find the best one on the market right now. Obsessive nerd that I am, I got a few- and then I borrowed a few more from my colleages to get my hands on every current fitness tracker. If you want to save on some reading, go run out (hah!) and get the Fitbit Flex.

## The Things That Actually Matter
It turns out, when it comes to your fitness wristband, there's a very small number of features that matter. There may be bells and whistles and dodads galore, but while nice, those are not going to be the things that piss you off when trying to become a walking datapoint. In testing, I found there is really only one thing that will be a consistent source of frustration: taking it off. Removing the wristband to charge or sync is one more opportunity for you to forget the wristband, creating gaps in your data. Since all the devices must remove to charge and offer comprable battery life, you'll have to remove the wristband at least for that. Removing to sync however, that's just silly.

In fact, at this point, let's just stop talking about the Jawbone UP. If you'd like, go to a store and try to cram the 3.5mm headphone plug attached to the wristband itself past your iPhone or Android case. Then imagine doing that every day because you want to see your data. Then imagine returning your device in a fit of rage. I'm still confused how a leader in bluetooth made a manually syncing wristband.

It's also worth mentioning that "being discontinued" is a deal breaker as well. So, let's just rule out the Motoactiv since Motorola [decided fitness wasn't cool/profitable anymore](http://www.droiddog.com/android-blog/2012/07/motorola-discontinues-motoactv-drops-price-to-clear-inventory/).

## Then There Were Two: Nike and Fitbit
So now that we are looking at not-discontinued fitness trackers that can actually sync wirelessly, we are left with two brands. The Nike+ Fuelband ($149) and the Fitbit Flex ($100) offer wireless sync, allow you to set a goal, and then go commence fitness until your goal is reached. From here on out, it's all about preferences. Both the devices are resizable, both of them track distance, and both of them put their data in pretty charts and graphs for you on their websites.

* **Simple** Nothing beats the Nike Fuelband. Their "fuel" measurement is a number and you simple active-your-butt-off until you hit said number. Fitbit's dots are pretty ambiguous, hard numbers simply motivate better.
* **Data Fiend** Sleeping? Active Minutes? Weight via wireless scale? Calories In/Out, water trackers, food logging, and the ability to export all this in CSV format? If you're one of those people, the Fitbit ecosystem is made for this. Nike's ecosystem (FuelBand, Nike+ Running, NTC, etc don't talk to each other still)
* **Have an iPhone?** You're okay with the Nike+ Fuelband or the Fitbit Flex.
* **Have an Android?** You're syncing the Nike+ Fuelband to your computer instead of phone. At least you're not using a headphone jack. Neither device syncs wirelessly to your Android phone yet.

I spent a week wearing both.

If you're wearing your device for looks and to get a general sense of your activity day to day, then the Nike+ Fuelband is your gadget. The LED style and readouts are really eye catching and turn heads. The red-to-green progression for your goal is awesome, and the little goal animations make the device fun. It's simple to set a goal, and simple to work towards it.

The Flex, however, is one more tool for someone who wants to see their data as part of a larger system. It's integration with other sites, the addition of WiFi friendly scales, and the complete dashboard help you really understand your fitness in the context of your long term goal. This idea is probably better reinforced with a snapshot of the dashboards.

In the end, Nike just can't seem to put up as much detail as Fitbit. Wearable fitness is as much about the second word as the first. If Nike+ can make their apps all part of one larger ecosystem, I believe they'll be a strong competitor. Until then, the FitBit has the winning position locked up.
