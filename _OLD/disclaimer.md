## Disclaimer
This is a collection of postings. It doesn't come with a warranty. It's not peer-reviewed. You should probably search the internet for additional opinions beyond this one. You also shouldn't be typing in `rm -rf` into your console just because a page on the internet told you it was a good idea.

This post you were reading also doesn't reflect the the thoughts, intentions, opinions and plans of my employer. The opinions expressed are mine and mine alone.

Finally, this post also represents an opinion at a moment in time. While I will do my best to ensure changing opinions are reflected in the article or in an **update** note in the blog itself, our industry and its opinions are constantly evolving and one shouldn't rely on older information as being authoritative. Even if `rm -rf` is still a swell idea.

## Commenting
The heart of our industry is a healthy discourse. I welcome discussion of all kinds, although I prefer we remain somewhat close to the topic at hand. I reserve the right to delete any comment for any reason, although I will reserve that for things that detract from the conversation in the form of being an asshole on the internet. Keep it polite, and we'll get along fine.
