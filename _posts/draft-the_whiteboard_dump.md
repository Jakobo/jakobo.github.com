title: The Whiteboard Dump
---

It's time to get started on the large engineering project, but there's a need for a plan, some kind of documentation. *Sure* you think, *I'll just pull up my wiki/email/text editor and-* And what? Set the keyboard down. There is often a better way to get everything out of your head than wandering through your computer which will inevitably end in YouTube videos of a cat dancing to Gangnam Style. You need a blank canvas you can get your ideas onto that isn't encumbered with technology. Welcome to the Whiteboard Dump.

Dumping onto a Whiteboard is an amazing process. The ideas you generate will be stronger, more people will be involved in the idea, and it'll all stick in your head better for later recall.

Let's get in to the dump.

NOTE: I like how this is becoming about HOW TO DUMP





Usually in engineering, we revolve around concepts and ideas. Code comes at a later point, sure, but unless you've built this exact thing before, there's going to be some unknowns. Drawing it out will force you to stop and think. As you start to explain on your board how everything relates, there's a good chance there will be some APIs that don't exist, or entire systems you never took into account. This is good! When I whiteboard, I tend to zone off a corner of the board for my "oh shit" moments, and when something like this comes up, I jot it down and keep going. I encourage you to do the same, there will be time to come back to it later.

The Brain Remembers, Then Amplifies
-----------------------------------
When you first learned to write, you were training your brain. It turns out that recalling how to form letters triggers a bunch of cells in your brain, waking it up so it pays closer attention to detail. These cells, known as the [Reticular Activating System, or RAS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reticular_activating_system) contribute to our ability to pay attention. Forcing yourself to physically write is a big shock of focus to your brain and the details stick. It keeps getting better though; added focus means your attention will begin to center on the problem at hand. The more you write, the more your brain will keep you on track. Keep at it, and you're bound to shake out something good.

Public is Better
----------------
I actually hate going into a conference room when it is time to start writing on a whiteboard. There's a good chance the guy three cubes down knows something you don't, and the instant your shut your "Meeting Door", that detail is never going to reach your board. Ideas can come from anywhere, and if you've reached a point where
