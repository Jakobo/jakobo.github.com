title: Stop Picking Things Just Because They're Fast
---

We are obsessed with fast. The large players has shown us that [Amazon gets 1% more revenue for every 100ms they save](http://www.strangeloopnetworks.com/resources/infographics/web-performance-and-ecommerce/amazon-100ms-faster-1-revenue-increase/), [Google ranks your site accounting for speed](http://googlewebmastercentral.blogspot.com/2010/04/using-site-speed-in-web-search-ranking.html), and we've been able to [strongly correlate page performance to engagement](http://googleresearch.blogspot.com/2009/06/speed-matters.html). However, I've been involved in an increasing number of unsettling conversations. In these conversations, entire frameworks are being considered or discarded based on benchmarks. Given our obsession with fast, [TODO: RATIONALIZE]. [TODO: TRANSITION]

## Rarely Apples
There's nothing as simple as [hello world](http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hello_world_program), right? Let's grab all the things we want to compare, put together a simple "hello world" example for them, load them up in our benchmarking tool and compare. Whatever is the fastest or has the most operations per second (one of our favorite phrases as JavaScript developers) is clearly the best, right? As long as you're in the department of building hello worlds, this makes sense. But what are we comparing at this point?

The first thing every engineer I know wants to do is benchmark "Hello World" apps in every framework and then compare the results for what is the "fastest". Don't get me wrong, [JSPerf](http://jsperf.com/faq) is a fantastic tool. You can create really robust test cases to compare performance across a wide variety of browsers. But to get a good comparison, you need to be comparing alike things.

## It's the API

## Make it Fast
See, as engineers, we have the ability to make things fast.
