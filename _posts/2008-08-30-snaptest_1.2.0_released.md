title: SnapTest 1.2.0 Released

*This is from the old archives. It's accuracy, links, code may all be funky or out of date.*

Things have been quiet over here on the site, mostly because I've been focused on things at work and polishing up SnapTest for 1.2.0. And really, that's a good a reason as any to get the blogging going again. First and foremost, [SnapTest](http://www.snaptest.net) 1.2.0 is out, and available for download. It comes with a slew of improvements and new things that should help make the testing process as painless as possible. Of all the things included, the most significant of these is the web testing interface.

I wrote recently on the topic of [Isolation Testing in PHP](http://www.felocity.org/blog/article/isolation_testing_in_php/) as part of 1.2, and two methods are available right out of the gate. The more conventional of methods uses php's proc_open command. The web interface though takes advantage of the server to fan out processes to do work. Using the [YUI Library](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui), the newest version sports a web interface using the YUI Get Utility (with a callback) to ensure every PHP test runs independently. As an added bonus, on obscure windows installs where the multi-process model was pitching fits, WAMP (A and M not required) can now do full isolation testing.

In addition to the web interface and the command line version of multi-process support, the Mock Object engine got an overhaul with full static method support and private method inspection. Lastly, TAP support has been really improved. The output streams, tests are counted before running, and notImplemented() was changed to todo() for marking tests that haven't been done yet.

All in all, it's a great release, and is strongly encouraged for all users to download. The release can be picked up either through [SnapTest Google Code](http://code.google.com/p/snaptest/downloads/list) or from [SnapTest GitHub](http://github.com/Jakobo/snaptest/tree/1.2.0). Happy testing.
