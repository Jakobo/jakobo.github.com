title: The Fitness Wristband Shootout
---

Ever since I invoked the 4 hour body and shed 50 pounds, I've been looking for simple ways to continue to measure my day to day progress. As my weight has shifted up or down, I've been trying to identify outliers in behavior that caused the change. Lucky for me, 2013 is the year of the "wearable fitness". Nike, Fitbit, Jawbone, and Motorola are all in the game. At an uncomfortable sum of money per wristband though, it's an expensive experiment to try them all and find the best one on the market right now. Obsessive nerd that I am, I got a few- and then I borrowed a few more from my colleages to get my hands on every current fitness tracker. If you want to save on some reading, go run out (hah!) and get the Fitbit Flex.

## The Things That Actually Matter
It turns out, when it comes to your fitness wristband, there's a very small number of features you care about. There may be bells and whistles and dodads galore, but while nice, those are not going to be the things that piss you off when trying to become a walking datapoint. There are only two things that will actually anger you about your fitness device: taking it off to sync, and taking it off to charge. Every time that wristband comes off, it's one more chance to forget it, leaving holes in your data. Since all the devices boast five or more days of battery life, it's usually the syncing that's the regular operation.

In fact, at this point, let's just stop talking about the Jawbone UP. If you'd like, go to a store and try to cram the 3.5mm headphone plug attached to the wristband itself past your iPhone or Android case. Then imagine doing that every day because you want to see your data. Then imagine returning your device in a fit of rage. I'm still confused how a leader in bluetooth made a manually syncing wristband. Don't be fooled by the brand.

I lied, there's a third thing that matters. Not being discontinued. So, let's just rule out the Motoactiv since Motorola [decided fitness wasn't cool/profitable anymore](http://www.droiddog.com/android-blog/2012/07/motorola-discontinues-motoactv-drops-price-to-clear-inventory/).

## Then There Were Two: Nike and Fitbit
So now that we are looking at not-discontinued fitness trackers that can actually sync wirelessly, we are left with two brands. The Nike+ Fuelband ($149) and the Fitbit Flex ($100) offer wireless sync, allow you to set a goal, and then go commence fitness until your goal is reached. To be honest, everything else past the "plugging your wristband in" is gravy. It will completely come down to the phone you have, what you'd like to track, and what look you actually want. Both the devices are resizable, both of them track distance, and both of them put their data in pretty charts and graphs for you on their websites.

* **Simple** Nothing beats the Nike Fuelband. Their "fuel" measurement is a number and you simple active-your-butt-off until you hit said number.
* **Data Fiend** Sleeping? Active Minutes? Weight via wireless scale? Calories In/Out, water trackers, food logging, and the ability to export all this in CSV format? If you're one of those people, the Fitbit Flex and site combined track all of this.
* **Have an iPhone?** You're okay with the Nike+ Fuelband or the Fitbit Flex.
* **Have an Android?** You're syncing the Nike+ Fuelband to your computer instead of phone. At least you're not using a headphone jack.

I spent a week wearing both.

If you're wearing your device for looks and to get a general sense of your activity day to day, then the Nike+ Fuelband is your gadget. The LED style and readouts are really eye catching and turn heads. The red-to-green progression for your goal is awesome, and the little goal animations make the device fun. It's simple to set a goal, and simple to work towards it.

And that's why I prefer the Flex (wait, what?!) See, the Flex tracks more data passively, and the ecosystem is much more complete than Nike's. When you're wearing "wearable fitness" for the second word, you want to make sure you're making progress towards your goal. Not the daily goal, but the long term goal.

This idea is probably better reinforced with a snapshot of the dashboards...

In the end, Nike just can't seem to put up as much detail as Fitbit. Fitbit is able to tell you when the status quo changes so you can react. The device you're wearing is helping you be better at your fitness. And that's what wearable fitness is really about.
