I have conversed with Eric Meyer twice in my life. The first time was a electronic question on his reset.css file. The second was in person at my first ever An Event Apart. In these two conversations, the mysteries of CSS were dispersed and I saw through him a beautiful web. I drifted away from servers and into the world of the browser. For many of us in the web industry, Eric is a mentor and an inspiration.

Since the middle of last year, Eric and his wife Kat have shared with the world [a parent's nightmare: their battle with cancer](http://meyerweb.com/eric/thoughts/category/personal/cancer). Their second child Rebecca was diagnosed in August with grade 3 (anaplastic) astrocytoma. Day by day we watched, hoped, and prayed for their daughter to win a battle that wasn't of her choosing.

Rebecca Alison Meyer passed away June 7, 2014. She was six years, eleven and a half hours old.

[Matt Robin](https://twitter.com/mattrobin140s/status/476109575532601344) and [Jeffery Zeldman](http://www.zeldman.com/2014/06/10/the-color-purple/) have asked that those who have been touched by the Meyerses to tweet "#663399Becca" with their condolences or to simply share the hashtag. This page, [all the tweets](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23663399Becca), and all that will be said in person and online cannot begin express the collective sadness we all share. Eric, Kat, Carolyn, and Joshua: may the pages, the blogs, the tweets, and the comments all find you in this difficult time.

[The family requests](http://meyerweb.com/eric/thoughts/2014/06/09/in-memoriam-2/) charitable donations be made in Rebecca's name to the Philadelphia Ronald McDonald House or the St. Baldrick's Foundation.
