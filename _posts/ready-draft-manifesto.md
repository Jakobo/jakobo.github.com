title: One Programmer's Manifesto
---

When mentoring other developers, I get asked a lot what process I go through when I am picking my battles. When that happens, I go grab my manifesto.

// Why a manifesto? What is a manifesto, and why should I have one? I feel that this aspect of your take is missing. Some of the thoughts below should be here, I think. Particularly the thoughts about prioritization and decision-making.

[![My Professional Manifesto](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-9wQSz5S3f3A/U5T3ktSPwEI/AAAAAAAAPX4/JkMXmgwhmgY/s200/2014-06-manifesto.png)](/resources/manifesto/2014-06-manifesto.pdf)

It didn't actually start with the design you see above. Originally, it was just a text file I kept on my computer and would revisit every few months. A manifesto is a powerful way to communicate your values and beliefs. While I have a [personal manifesto for my everyday life](http://linktoyourpersonalmanifesto.com), I have this one easily accessible where I do my work. When I am prioritizing things that need my attention, and I must make either/or choices, having your manifesto handy gives me a stern reminder of the things I valued when you sat down to write my beliefs down.

## It Reflects You
Manifestos do not need to be public. They don't ask to be designed. A manifesto, however, will only multiply the value you put into it; so be honest with yourself. Be willing to challenge your opinions, and be open to changing your manifesto over time. You'll notice the above manifesto is dated. I've evolved my manifesto a few times now as I have moved companies, positions, and learned new things. As we grow, our values change and the manifesto we look to should change to reflect the things most important to us.

## Write Your Own
To get started writing your own manifesto, take a pass at the following questions:

What should people in your position do for themselves?  
What should people in your position do for their employer?  
What is a piece of career advice you never want to forget?  
What quality do you most value in yourself?  
What inspirational quote resonates best with you?

With the above, you should have 3-5 sentences of content.

// Maybe talk about the "short but sweet" approach to manifestos? You want sayings and tweetable phrases, not necessarily full-on sentences.

You'll also have the start of your professional manifesto. If you'd prefer more visual inspiration, a [search for manifestos on Pinterest](http://www.pinterest.com/search/pins/?q=manifesto) offers a neverending supply of visual ideas. If you've thought through yours and you are interested in sharing, I'd love to see other individuals' beliefs below in the comments.

Many thanks to [Micah Alpern](https://www.linkedin.com/in/malpern) and [Shana Hu](http://shanahu.com/) for their help in converting the above manifesto from text to graphical form.
