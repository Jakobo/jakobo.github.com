title: One Programmer's Manifesto
---

When mentoring other developers, I get asked a lot what process I go through when I am picking my battles. When that happens, I go grab my manifesto. Defined as "[a written statement declaring publicly the intentions, motives, or views of its issuer](http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/manifesto)," a manifesto is a powerful way to communicate your values and beliefs. While I have a personal manifesto for my everyday life, I have this one easily accessible where I do my work.

[![My Professional Manifesto](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-9wQSz5S3f3A/U5T3ktSPwEI/AAAAAAAAPX4/JkMXmgwhmgY/s200/2014-06-manifesto.png)](/resources/manifesto/2014-06-manifesto.pdf)

When I am prioritizing things that need my attention and I must make difficult choices, having my manifesto handy gives me a stern reminder of the things I value. It helps me understand why certain issues are more hot button than others and allows for a conversation around what I've offered up as important. When you find yourself looking for your next career move, having a professional manifesto will also let you compare your values to the company's values and find the perfect culture fit.

## It Reflects You
Manifestos do not need to be public. They don't ask to be designed. A manifesto, however, will only multiply the value you put into it; so be honest with yourself. Be willing to challenge your opinions, and be open to changing your manifesto over time. You'll notice the above manifesto is dated. I've evolved my manifesto a few times now as I have moved companies, positions, and learned new things. As we grow, our values change and the manifesto we look to should change to reflect the things most important to us.

## Write Your Own
To get started writing your own manifesto, take a pass at the following questions:

What should people in your position do for themselves?  
What should people in your position do for their employer?  
What is a piece of career advice you never want to forget?  
What quality do you most value in yourself?  
What inspirational quote resonates best with you?

Your answers at this point do not need to be short and quotable. You'll probably have 3-5 sentences of content, and that's the start of your professional manifesto. The refinement of your manifesto will come as you better understand your answers to the above questions. If you'd prefer more visual inspiration, a [search for manifestos on Pinterest](http://www.pinterest.com/search/pins/?q=manifesto) offers a neverending supply of visual ideas. If you've thought through yours and you are interested in sharing, I'd love to see other individuals' beliefs below in the comments.
