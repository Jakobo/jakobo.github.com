title: I'm Sorry, I Won't Do Your Take Home Coding Exercise
---

I have a policy of sticking my head up above water every few years and seeing where our industry has gone. Usually, this involves talking to friends at various companies and doing exploratory talks with other recruiters. Lately, I've noticed an increase in the number of companies that want you to complete a "take home coding exercise" as part of the process. I'm sorry, but I won't do your take home coding activity. It's bad for you, it's bad for me, and there are many other ways we can both get what we want without this spec work hurdle.

## Bad For You
I totally understand the company side of this; take home activities offer a really effective way to get the candidate producing code which can be screened at the luxury of the company. You can save employee time by only interviewing people who have produced code that meets a minimum bar for entry. You can even use this code during the on-site interview for follow up questions and diving deeper into the work to understand how the candidate built the mini application you created for them. By raising the barrier to entry, you've also ensured only people who really want to work at your company will proceed with the interview process. It sounds amazing on paper.

The take home test takes more work than just handing everyone a question though. The internet allows every question you produce (and their solutions) to be shared at near-instant speed. Creating new questions takes a significant investment in time; problems must be self-contained for candidates and engineers must be retrained on evaluating the new code samples arriving.

If the engineer thinks the code is flawless, then the question is probably on the internet. If the code was absolutely terrible, it's unlikely a good recruiter would have moved on to the take home activity in the first place. Lastly, if the engineer thinks the code is okay, but has questions, then you are interviewing the candidate on the same criteria that the take home activity was supposed to solve.

## Bad For Me (the Candidate)
Things are even worse when one considers the other side of the interviewing relationship. Sending every probable candidate a take home activity is the engineering equivalent of [spec work](http://www.nospec.com/faq). "Here," you say, "please build for me this fictitious application. There is no reward for completion, but I may offer to pay you later." In a single stroke of an email, you've devalued the candidate and their time.

Passive candidates don't have time, as they were quite happy with what they were doing (hence, passive). These candidates often are spending their non-work time having families, pursuing hobbies, or contributing to open source projects. For these people, nothing is a bigger buzzkill than an activity that offers nothing to the candidate other than more of the same work they do.

Active candidates may have time, but they are definitely dividing their time amongst the many places they might want to work. Unless your company is the soul mate of the candidate, it's unlikely you'll ever.

Nothing screams "I don't trust you" more than asking someone who is currently writing code to perform tricks for the evaluation of people the candidate has never met.
