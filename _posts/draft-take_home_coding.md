title: I'm Sorry, I Won't Do Your Take Home Coding Exercise
---

I have a policy of sticking my head up above water every few years and seeing where our industry has gone. Usually, this involves talking to friends at various companies and doing exploratory talks with other recruiters. Lately, I've noticed an increase in the number of companies that want you to complete a "take home coding exercise" as part of the process before you even move into a more formal interview. I've begun responding to recruiters with an apology: I don't do take home coding exercises.

## Bad For You
I totally understand the company side of this; take home activities offer a really effective way to get the candidate producing code which can be screened at the luxury of the company. You can save employee time by only interviewing people who have produced code that meets a minimum bar for entry. You can even use this code during the on-site interview for follow up questions and diving deeper into the work to understand how the candidate built the mini application you created for them. By raising the barrier to entry, you've also ensured only people who really want to work at your company will proceed with the interview process. It sounds amazing on paper.

The take home test takes more work than just handing everyone a question though. The internet allows every question you produce (and their solutions) to be shared at near-instant speed. Creating new questions takes a significant investment in time; problems must be self-contained for candidates and engineers must be retrained on evaluating the new questions. Once the exercise comes back, an engineer needs to sit down and review the code.

If the engineer thinks the code is flawless, then the question is probably on the internet. If the code was absolutely terrible, it's unlikely a good recruiter would have moved on to the take home activity in the first place. Lastly, if the engineer thinks the code is okay, but has questions, then you are interviewing the candidate on the same criteria that the take home activity was supposed to solve. Except now as the interviewing company, you were not privy to their development process and how they arrived at the result.

## Bad For Me (the Candidate)
Things are even worse when one considers the other side of the interviewing relationship. Sending a take home activity to an engineer sends a very clear message that your company doesn't value their time. "Please build for me this fictitious thing", you say. "Complete this task, and we may let you talk to an engineer." That's a large hurdle to someone who doesn't even know if they would really like to be a part of your company in the first place.

Passive candidates don't have time, as they were quite happy with what they were doing (hence, passive). These candidates often are spending their non-work time having families, pursuing hobbies, or contributing to open source projects. For these people, nothing is a bigger buzzkill than an activity that offers nothing to the candidate other than more of the same work they do.

Active candidates have the time. Since they are actively looking for a new opportunity, it's safe to say there's definitely more than one company they are talking to. In this scenario, asking the candidate to take 3 days for a coding activity is three days everyone else is actually talking to the candidate, assessing fit, and selling the candidate on the awesomeness of their respective companies.

There are thousands of opportunities in the industry. When a company sends the "we don't trust you, so prove yourself" email, that company gets mentally shuffled lower in the queue for both active and passive candidates alike.

## A Better Answer: Ask
It doesn't have to be like this. Our industry has already built [LinkedIn](http://www.linkedin.com), [Stack Overflow](http://www.stackoverflow.com), [Github](http://github.com) and [BitBucket](http://bitbucket.org), [TopCoder](http://topcoder.com), and hundreds of other places where developers can show the work. As a recruiter or engineer, ask them for code samples (or simply use Google and look). If you've scoured the internet and there's still no code to be had, then schedule a call where the candidate and engineer can solve a small problem together with a remote coding solution. Not only will the company get a chance to see the candidate's development process, the candidate will have the opportunity to learn more about what it is like to work with the team.

So, sorry, I won't do your take home coding exercise. If you'd like to talk, I'll be over here, coding.
