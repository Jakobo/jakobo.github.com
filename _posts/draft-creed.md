title: A Programmer's Creed
---

_I ask. I think globally, then write locally. I leverage the work of others. My new code will always be better. I ship._ I've got this printed out and next to my monitor at work. I think every engineer would benefit in writing down what they value in their job and what their principles are. The benefits of writing down a manifesto like this are as much practical as psychological. First, it makes you decide what you really value in your work. Second, in moments of weakness, it's great to have a reminder to nudge you towards your idea of engineering greatness. There will be two people who are reading this. There are those who want to understand the meaning and intent behind my creed, and there are those who want to write their own.

If you're the kind of do-it-yourselfer, write down everything that matters to you in code. Record every little nit that drives you crazy. Now that you have a nice long list, what of those things would make you quit? Take those, massage them, and make them short, concise, and actionable.

## Asking Questions

## Think Globally, but Write Locally

## Leveraging the Work of Others

## Constantly Improve

## Above All, Ship
