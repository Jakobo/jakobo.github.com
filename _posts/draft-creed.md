title: A Programmer's Creed
---

_I ask. I write locally, but think globally. I strive to leverage the work of others. I constantly improve. I remember to ship._ It's simple, short, and explains how I approach software development. Call it a manifesto, a creed, a belief system, but everyone has one and it's good to write it down and what it stands for. I have mine on my laptop and it stares back at me every time I sit down to write code. I consider these good traits in an engineer, and thus, all things I work to achieve in my projects, from open source initiatives to my company's product work, to the things I do on this blog.

Asking Questions
----------------
To this day, I'm amazed at how few questions engineers ask. By defintion, if we are performing Computer _Science_, then we should be asking questions and challenging established ideas.

Writting Locally, Thinking Globally

Leveraging the Work of Others

Constantly Improve
------------------

Above All, Ship
