title: A Programmer's Creed
---

_I ask. I write locally, but think globally. I strive to leverage the work of others. I constantly improve. I remember to ship._ It's simple, short, and explains how I approach software development. Call it a manifesto, a creed, a belief system, but everyone who has ever considered themselves an engineer has a set of ideals they believe in. Don't believe me? Ask any engineer you know what matters to them in code the write. I swear, it helps us sleep at night. These happen to be mine. I consider these good traits in an engineer, and thus, all things I work to achieve in my projects, from open source initiatives to my company's product work, to the things I do on this blog.

## Asking Questions
Phil was an employee I used to work with who had a knack for asking questions. It started out with the simple stuff;, the "how do I X" and "why did we do Y" type questions. When nobody around him knew, he'd take a walk around the office. Every time he did this process, he would either find the answer he was looking for, or meet someone who also had an interest in his problem. He moved faster than many of my colleagues who would mire through debuggers and lines of code just to solve basic tasks. Phil got noticed for engaging everyone (and getting his code out) so much, they eventually asked him to lead a team. He already knew the basics, so by this point, his questions got a lot harder. He started asking about business value, strategy, and purpose. He got people around him to do the same. His team began to pull away from the main organization, delivering perceived value faster than anyone else could even imagine. They were machines. Question asking machines.

When Phil left, his legacy stuck around long after his departure. Every one of us who worked with Phil took his approach to heart when it came to problems. Asking questions is a very simple form of communication. You end up meeting, interacting, and learning from everyone in the organization when you do it. At my current job, I've taken to running an entire meeting that revolves around asking hard questions. You'd be amazed at how many people almost ended up working on the exact same thing.

## Writting Locally, Thinking Globally
I usually find this point to be the hardest to explain to people. As people grow their skills in shipping products (I'm going to limit this to the web), they evolve into one of two camps. The pragmatists who just want things done, and the perfectionists who put the right way above all others. The reality lies somewhere in the middle, and that's normally what goes out to users. The failing then, is when we fail as a discipline to put thought into the life after the product ships. I'm not advocating for [solving all the problems](http://xkcd.com/974/) outright, but knowing what you intended goes a long way.

## Leveraging the Work of Others

## Constantly Improve

## Above All, Ship
