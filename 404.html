    <p>Well, crap. You probably followed a link from somewhere and things were broken. Let me try and get you on the right track. Below are some possible places to look. If none of those are right and you still can't find what you were looking for, my email is at the bottom. Drop me a line.</p>

    <ul>
      <li><a href="/">Home</a> has links to all my writing, code, and other things I've created</li>
      <li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141219202148/http://www.felocity.com/">Archive.org</a> actually has a very good collection of the articles and postings from the jekyll page days</li>
      <li><a href="http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:www.felocity.org&amp;strip=1">felocity.org</a>: For really old things, there is a Google cache of the site. Especially if you want the really old PHP 4 content.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Still no luck? Email me at jakob<span style="display:none">fizzbuzz</span>@felocity.com and I'll do my best to help.</p>
